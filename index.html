            <strong> Telescope </strong> <br>
            The **Kepler Space Telescope**<br>
            was a groundbreaking space observatory launched by NASA in 2009,<br>
            dedicated to discovering Earth-like planets orbiting other<br>
            stars in our galaxy.<br>
            Named after the renowned astronomer Johannes Kepler,<br>
            this telescope revolutionized our<br>
            understanding of the universe<br>
            by focusing on a small patch of the Milky Way<br>
            to detect planets through the transit method—observing tiny dips in a star's brightness<br>
            as a planet passes in front of it.<br><br>
        
            **Key Achievements:**<br>
            - **Exoplanet Discoveries**: Kepler identified over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets,<br>
              many of which are potentially habitable and similar in size to Earth.<br>
            - **Expanding the Hunt**: It revealed that planets are common in the galaxy,<br>
              with billions potentially orbiting in the habitable zones of their stars.<br>
            - **Legacy**: The mission concluded in 2018, but Kepler’s data<br>
              continues to provide insights, shaping our search for life beyond Earth<br>
              and guiding future missions.<br><br>
        
            Kepler’s discoveries have fundamentally changed our view of our place in the universe,<br>
            showing that Earth-like planets may be more common than once thought,<br>
            and paving the way for future explorations of distant worlds.<br>
